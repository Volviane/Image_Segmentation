   * use:
     * "final" decisions about points
     * mark regions of interest (fore/back) --> mask
   * simple methods
     * LOCV: pg 136
     * pure thresh; thresh back -> 0, fore -> its value; similar
   * neighborhood methods
     * (adaptive)  used when uneven illumination
     * local neighborhood:
       * value from mean (equal weight) or weighted-average based on Gaussian
       * compute value, subtract C ---> threshold for that neighborhood

      requires interpolation
      * interpolation methods (see Dawson, ch 5.5)
        * can result in fractional values
        * nearest neighbor rounds to fill integer pixel spots
        * also more complicated methods
        * bilinear:  average in 2D (see wiki graphic)
        * bicubic:  cubic fit in 2D over 4x4 window
    * decreasing resolution (throwing out data) requires "decimation"
      * convolve with low-pass; keep rth sample points
